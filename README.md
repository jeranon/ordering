# ordering
a cobbled together solution to create and print reordering tags using a qr code, 3 delimiters (cumbersome, I know... lots of reasons, but the primary reason now, is I don't want to reprint hundreds of tags...) itemCode{vendor|description}orderQty, and some good old fashioned can-do attitude. Uses Python, Excel, Word

I've had to do manually set the CMD properties for the window to be 160 columns x 40 rows, and then the only thing I can define in the actual code is the buffer size.
